If you use `environment.yml`, then Binder will use a Miniconda distribution
to install your packages. However, you may still want to use `pip`. In
this case, you should **not** use a `requirements.txt` file, but instead use
a `- pip` section in `environment.yml`. This repository is an example of how
to construct your `environment.yml` file to accomplish this.

# Overview

Psi4Education is the education and outreach program of the [Psi4](psicode.org)
electronic structure software package.  Psi4Education offers a suite of "dry"
computational chemistry lab activities, suitable for classes across the chemistry
curriculum. 

## Getting Started

All lab activities and instructional materials are provided free of charge, and
can be downloaded directly as a [zipped
archive](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/archive/master.zip) or
by [cloning this
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
If you are a faculty member or instructor and would like to receive access to
instructor guides, answer keys, and other resources, please [contact
us](mailto:armcdona@calpoly.edu?subject=[p4edu%20GitHub]%20Psi4Education%20Instructor%20Access).
In your request, please use Psi4Education in your subject line, and let us know
your affiliation, institutional e-mail address, GitHub username, and a brief
description of the course or courses where you would use the Psi4Education
resources.

### Required Software

Since Psi4Education provides computational chemistry labs, it might be expected
that there is some required software to install or download in order for you or
your students to enjoy these activities. Fortunately, however, all lab
activities may be performed online using either the [WebMO Demo
Server](https://www.webmo.net/demo/) or JupyterHub through our partnership with
[Chem Compute](https://chemcompute.org/jupyterhub).

### Available Resources

All laboratory activities can be found in the
[`labs/`](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/tree/master/labs)
directory, within which all labs are separated into their own subdirectories.
Psi4Education offers two distinct types of laboratory exercises: 
* WebMO labs, which utilize the WebMO graphical front-end user interface to
facilitate performing quantum chemistry computations, and
* Python labs, in which quantum chemistry computations, data collection,
and analysis are performed using the Python programming language within the
Jupyter notebook development environment.

## Contributing to Psi4Education

There are several ways to become involved with Psi4Education, each of which are
highly valuable, and will help Psi4Education to better serve the needs of the
chemical education community at large. You can help by
* [submitting an
issue](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/issues/new/choose) if you
find a mistake or want to request a new lab,
* making your voice heard by participating in discussions on [existing
issues](https://github.com/psi4education/psi4education/issues) raised on this
repository, 
* updating/adding features to existing content, or 
* by submitting new content.  

>If you are interested in submitting a new lab activity, we would love to hear
from you! Please learn how by checking out our [contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
